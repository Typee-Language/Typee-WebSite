<h1>- Typee Language Lessons -</h1>
<strong>Typee</strong> language is a new generic <em>Object Oriented Programming </em>language. The syntax of this programming language is somewhat new while it has been largely inspired by <em>OOP</em> languages such as <em>C++11</em>, <em>Java 8</em> or <em>Python 3.7</em>.

To be able to efficiently program with <strong>Typee</strong>, the characteristics of the language have to be learned.

So, here is the place to learn programming with <strong>Typee</strong> but... this documentation is currently under writing.

Never mind. You will soon get here the underlying concepts of the language. You will be explained its grammar as well as its syntax. You will learn how to use it efficiently, not only about <strong>programming </strong>in Typee or about <strong>implementing algorithms </strong>in Typee, but also about <strong>how to translate</strong> your Typee programs in <em>Python 3</em>, <em>Java 8</em> or <em>C++11 </em>and how your Typee source code <strong>interfaces with</strong> these targetted foreign programming languages.

Isn't this really exciting?

<h2>3 - Typee Language Description</h2>
<h3>3.1 - Language Generalities</h3>
<code style="font-size:120%;"><strong>Typee</strong></code> is an Object Oriented Programming language. As any OOP language, it defines classes and their inheritance concept.

It defines also functions and traditionnal statements (i.e. instructions) plus some bonuses (e.g. <code style="font-size:120%;"><strong>otherwise</strong></code> associated with <code style="font-size:120%;"><strong>for</strong></code> or <code style="font-size:120%;"><strong>while</strong></code> as in <em>Python</em> or with <code style="font-size:120%;"><strong>switch</strong></code> in <em>C++</em> and <em>Java</em>).

Scalar operators will be of no surprise to programmers, even for not much experienced ones. Typee understands 0-shifting as does <em>Jave</em> and offers a few not-defined operators which are accepted by the language and which are for users specific definitions.

Scalar types are generic enough also, while they are precisely named in Typee for definitively unambiguous understanding of their sizes. Auto typing is not only allowed, it is inherent in language.

Functions, methods and operators may be templated.

If you don't know what are <em>comprehensions</em>, which are common in <em>Python</em>, you will understand thieir use with clauses <code style="font-size:120%;"><strong>for</strong></code> and <code style="font-size:120%;"><strong>if</strong></code>.

<code style="font-size:120%;"><strong>list</strong></code>, <code style="font-size:120%;"><strong>set</strong></code>, <code style="font-size:120%;"><strong>dict</strong></code>, and <code style="font-size:120%;"><strong>array</strong></code> are built-in containers. The three first types are well known from <em>Python</em> programmers. The last one is well known from <em>C++</em> and <em>Java</em> programmers, as well as from Python programmers using library <em>NumPy</em>.

Typee handles classical exceptions. This concept helps programmers deal with unexpected errors at run time. By no way is it different in Typee from other OOP languages (<em>Python</em>, <em>C++</em> and <em>Java</em>).

It defines unnamed functions (as does <em>Java</em> or <em>Python</em> with <code style="font-size:120%;"><strong>lambdas</strong></code>)

Important: THE very specific statement with Typee is instruction <code style="font-size:120%;"><strong>embed</strong></code>. Since Typee is to be translated into other languages, it seems very natural to be allowed to <em>embed</em> some native code into Typee programs. This is exactly what <code style="font-size:120%;"><strong>embed</strong></code> permits.

Finally, Typee offers also few other goodies that you will enjoy to use.

<h2>Open Source code</h2>
The source code of Typee Project is <strong>Open Source</strong>. It can, as a whole, be freely accessed on its GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/Typee-Language/Typee">https://github.com/Typee-Language/Typee</a>. Notice that Typee software is currently under development and that on GitHub, you can get direct access to the modifications of the code as well as to the corresponding documentation that is also managed with GitHub.

If you don't know what GitHub is, then you maybe are not a software developer or you are a very newby one. Nevertheless, this should not be a concern to you since you might be not contributing to the <strong>Typee</strong> software development. In the meantime, we encourage you to have a look at <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a>. By scrolling the main page of this Web site you will get an overview of how members of a software (<em>S/W</em>) development team may collaborate to jointly develop softwares.

As being an Open Source Project, Typee project is delivered under a license. The license we have chosen for this is one of the most permissive ones, the MIT license. Here is a copy of its legal text as inserted at the top level of Typee GitHub Repository as well as in any source code file.

This just means that anyone may use, modify, deliver <strong>Typee source code</strong> free of charge for any kind of use: educational, personal, commercial or whatever, <strong>but</strong> with one constraint. If you do so, you <strong>must</strong> provide or maintain as they are the above copyright notice and this permission notice with any part of <strong>Typee source code</strong> that you would use. Of course, you are supposed not to claim the property of <strong>Typee source code</strong> and have to cite the original copyright with every part of <strong>Typee source code</strong> you would be using in your code.

&nbsp;
<h3>The above license notice relates only to Typee source code</h3>
We expect language <strong>Typee </strong>to be used for software development, due to its many advantages. Of course, any software developed in programming language <strong>Typee</strong> remains the sole property of its developer and, as such, is not subject to any interference with the Typee source code license.
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This means that anything you would code in Typee will be <strong>your</strong> <strong>own </strong>code and will be <strong>your own </strong>intellectual property</em>.</p>
Then, you <strong>will not have </strong>to reproduce the above MIT License for the software you develop and you are definitively allowed to choose any other license for your software, it being developped with language Typee or not (but it will eventually be, trust us).

This MIT license is only attached to the source code developped for the <strong>Typee Project</strong> and since this MIT license allows you to reuse any part of the code developed within this project, it states that you are just neither allowed to removed the notices from the source code you reuse by your side nor allowed to claim its property. Use it as you wish, nevertheless.

<h2>About Credits</h2>
We have to credit GitHub for our extensive use of their services. The code we develop for project Typee is systematically shared there between our team members (remember, we are a team of <em>software development warriors</em>). And this is for free since we develop Open Source code. So cool...

We have to credit WordPress for the extensive use we have with their Internet software. All the content of the pages that are available on this site, as well as the pictures, are shared and most of the time modified by our team members right in their great tool. And this is for free also.

We have to credit Hash Themes for their great WordPress theme <em>Square</em> that we use in its free form for the global and the pages themes of our Web site. See a link at the very bottom of this page to get access to their theme. Remember, this is for free again. Thank you so much, guys.

We have to credit OVH for the hosting of our Web site. Well, we pay for that but the price for the .ovh extension is so low...

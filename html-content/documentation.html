<h1>- Typee Documentation -</h1>
You will find here the whole documentation of language <strong>Typee</strong>. Up today it is still under creation since this Web site has been created on Aug. 1st, 2018, but very first documentation pages are very soon to come.

In the meantime, do not hesitate to have a look at Typee <a href="https://github.com/Typee-Language/Typee">repository</a>. You will get there a full access to the current status of the <strong>Typee Project</strong> development. There, documentation is also available, either directly as <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Mark Down</a> documents (mainly, readme.md files) or as <em>HTML </em>documentation of the already developed code for <strong>Typee</strong> language implementation.

Up today available sections are:

<blockquote>
1. <a href="http://www.typee.ovh/index.php/documentation/doc-01-intro/">Documentation Introduction</a>
2. <a href="http://www.typee.ovh/index.php/doc-02-language-specs/">Typee Grammar Specifications</a>
3. <a href="http://www.typee.ovh/index.php/doc-03-language-descr/">Typee Language Full Description</a> (<em>currently on progress</em>)
Annex A. <a href="http://www.typee.ovh/index.php/doc-aa-sota/">A State of the Art on Translation of Computer Languages</a>
</blockquote>

Please remember that this site is currently under construction.
As soon as section <a href="http://www.typee.ovh/index.php/doc-03-language-descr/">3.</a> will have been completed, we will invite you to not hesitate to go straight to it, to get a deep inside view of the language characteristics.
A section 4. (still to come) will provide also a deep dive into built-in libraries programmed in <strong>Typee</strong>.

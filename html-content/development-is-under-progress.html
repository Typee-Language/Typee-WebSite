We are currently encountering an overloaded period of time.

We are working on both this Web site and its related <a href="https://github.com/Typee-Language/Typee">GitHub repository</a>. Currently, we spend time to implement a translator from GitHub-Flavored MarkDown (<a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/">GFM</a>) text to HTML text conforming WordPress requirements. This way, we will be able to automate the translation of the whole documentation that is already available on the GitHub repository into HTML page for this Web site.

Once this work done, the Web site and the code development of <strong>Typee</strong> will both make big progress.

May we ask you to be a little bit patient?
Developments are on progress while they constitute the <span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="en"><span class="">immersed part of an iceberg. Soon, everything will be appearing to your sight.</span></span>
